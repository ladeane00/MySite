This project is being created to aid a national neural research project by presenting a digital iPad application assessment to be used by the researchers to gain data from participants. The test consists of naming as many words as possible that start with a specific letter within one minute. This process is repeated a few times and recorded into this iPad application interface I created. The researchers can then save the record to the iPad file system.
